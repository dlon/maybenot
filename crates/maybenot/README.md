# Maybenot ðŸ¤”

Maybenot is a framework for traffic analysis defenses that hide patterns in
encrypted communication. Its goal is to increase the uncertainty of network
attackers, hence its logo ðŸ¤” - the thinking face emoji (U+1F914).

Consider encrypted communication protocols such as TLS, QUIC, WireGuard, or Tor.
While the connections are encrypted, *patterns* in the encrypted communication
may still leak information about the communicated plaintext. Maybenot is a
framework for creating defenses that hide such patterns.

To simulate defenses based on Maybenot, see the [Maybenot
simulator](https://github.com/maybenot-io/maybenot-simulator/).

## Design
An instance of Maybenot repeatedly takes as *input* one or more *events*
describing the encrypted traffic going over an encrypted channel, and produces
as *output* zero or more *scheduled actions*, such as to inject *padding*
traffic or *block* outgoing traffic. One or more *state machines* determine what
actions to take based on events. State machines have a lightweight runtime and
are subject to *limits* on the amount of padding a blocking they can schedule.

Integration with an encrypted communication protocol is done by reporting events
and executing scheduled actions. Maybenot does not specify the specific async
runtime or how to keep time for sake of ease of integration.

## Example usage
```rust,no_run
use maybenot::{
framework::{Action, Framework, TriggerEvent},
machine::Machine,
};
use std::{str::FromStr, time::Instant};

// deserialize state machine from string
let s = "789cedca2101000000c230e85f1a8387009f9e351d051503ca0003";
let m = vec![Machine::from_str(s).unwrap()];

// create framework instance
let mut f = Framework::new(&m, 0.0, 0.0, 1420, Instant::now()).unwrap();

loop {
    // collect one or more events
    let events = [TriggerEvent::NonPaddingSent { bytes_sent: 1420 }];

    // trigger events, schedule actions, at most one per machine
    for action in f.trigger_events(&events, Instant::now()) {
        match action {
            Action::Cancel { machine: MachineId } => {
                // if any scheduled action for this machine, cancel it
            }
            Action::InjectPadding {
                timeout: Duration,
                size: u16,
                bypass: bool,
                replace: bool,
                machine: MachineId,
            } => {
                // schedule padding of a specific size after timeout
            }
            Action::BlockOutgoing {
                timeout: Duration,
                duration: Duration,
                bypass: bool,
                replace: bool,
                machine: MachineId,
            } => {
                // schedule blocking of outgoing traffic for duration after timeout
            }
        }
    }
}
 ```

## More details
See the [paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/3603216.3624953) and
[documentation](https://docs.rs/maybenot/latest/maybenot) for further details on
the framework.

Development of defenses using Maybenot is under active development. For some
early results, see
[https://github.com/ewitwer/maybenot-defenses](https://github.com/ewitwer/maybenot-defenses).

While v1 of the framework and simulator are stable, v2 is slowly shaping up as
we expand the capabilities of the framework. The goal is to keep the framework
as simple as possible, while still being expressive enough to implement a wide
range of defenses.

## Origin
Maybenot is based on the [Circuit Padding Framework of
Tor](https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/plain/doc/HACKING/CircuitPaddingDevelopment.md)
by Perry and Kadianakis from 2019, which is a generalization of the [WTF-PAD
Website Fingerprinting Defense](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.00524.pdf) design by
Juarez et al. from 2016, which in turn is based on the concept of [Adaptive
Padding](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~shmat/shmat_esorics06.pdf) by Shmatikov and
Wang from 2006.
